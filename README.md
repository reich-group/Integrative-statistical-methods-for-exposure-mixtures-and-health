Code for the paper "Integrative statistical methods for exposure mixtures and health"


The code in this folder simulates a dataset from each model, fits the models to the simulated data and summarizes the results.

The three models are run separately and the output each appear in a different html file.  

The .Rmd files have the code to simulate the data, fit the models and produce the output.

The .R files have the MCMC code used to generate posterior samples.
